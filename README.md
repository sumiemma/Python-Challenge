UCB Data Analysis Bootcamp Module 3 Python Challenge

## Installation

Software Visual Studio Code is being used to write the code, Git Bash used to general the results, and the environment is PythonDate, provided by UC Berkeley.


## Description

THis is the Module 3 challenge for the UC Berkeley Data Analyticd Boot Camp. In this assignment, there are two datasets we had to analyse. The first one is names PyBank, which we are required to analyse the financial situation of a company. Within the dataset, we are given the date (month and year), and the profit/loss. From there, using Python, we found the total number of months, the total profit/loss, and the average change in profit/loss, th greatest increase in profit, and the greatest decrease in porfit within that specific period of time.

The second dataset is the raw data of a vote-counting process for a small rural town, which contains the ballot ID, county and name of the candidate that was voted. With Python, we created a code to automatically generate the total number of votes, how many votes each candidate gets and the percentage, and finally announce who is the winner of the election.
